I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign advised by Professors [Yuguo Chen](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/yuguo) and [Ruoqing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/teazrq/home).

My research interests include statistical network analysis, Bayesian inference, machine learning, data science, and statistical computing.

### About

From 2015 to 2018, I was a Data Scientist at [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), a start-up in Boston aimed at building an automated machine learning platform. I received an M.S. in Physics from [Yale University](https://physics.yale.edu/) and a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from [Duke University](https://physics.duke.edu/). During my physics career, I worked as a particle phycisist as part of the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. There I performed large scale data analytics and contributed to the development of a Deep Learning framework for classifying subatomic-particle jets.
