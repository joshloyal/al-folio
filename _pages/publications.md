* Gershtein, Y. et al. (2013). **New particles working group report of the Snowmass 2013 community summer study**. In proceedings at *Community Summer Study 2013: Snowmass on the Mississippi (CSS2013)*. [[article]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0299v1)

* Cohen, T., Golling, T., Hance, M., Henrichs, A., Howe, K., *Loyal, J.*, Padhi, S., and Wacker, J. G.
